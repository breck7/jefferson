This is a 20 minute prototype of a new language idea for a system of laws/government that is: human readable, mathematically minimal, and strongly typed language.

I am posting in response to: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19993720

The benefits of this language are:

- complexity can be measured. in our present system of government, complexity is the weapon of special interests. With this language system, two "laws/patches" can be easily measured and it can be unjustifiable to pass the more complex version.
- clean code. every character counts and every line is version controlled. laws are easy to compute with.
- as little ambiguity as possible.
